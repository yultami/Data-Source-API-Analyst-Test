- **Approach**: Read the API documentation, write code to make requests, and process responses.

### Part 2: Set up a GitHub repository
- **Goal**: Create a structured repository to store all test materials.
- **Approach**: Create a repository, add a description and folder structure.

### Part 3: Authentication
- **Goal**: Implement an authentication process to access the GitHub API.
- **Approach**: Use access tokens and write code to authenticate.

### Part 4: Data Extraction
